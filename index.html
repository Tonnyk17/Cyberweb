            <h1>Night City</h1> 

            <p>Night City is considered a thrilling and exciting location to visit, 
                as well as an interesting and vibrant place to live for those of means, and a hellscape
                 to the city's disenfranchised; its world famous slogan is "The City on the Edge of Tomorrow". 
                 Technology triumphant over the troubles of the past United States of America, a combination of 
                 cultures of the Old World, and a new beginning of the U.S.; Night City is now.</p>

            <p>We get an introduction to the musicians behind the music 
             of Cyberpunk 2077. Groups and artists such as Run 
            the Jewels, Grimes, Refused, and A$AP Rocky

             of the game’s soundtrack.

            <h1>Cyberware</h1>
            <p>Even though cybernetic prosthetics were originally developed for practical and medical purposes, they’ve 
                since become a matter of lifestyle choice. In 2077, cyberware has become as commonplace as tattoos and jewelry. 
                The reasons for installing it are many and varied, including simple tech upgrades, combat enhancements, and even
                 fashion statements. The possession of trendy cyberware has become an integral and defining part of Night City
                  culture. Uniqueness is just another form of currency. To make it big, you need to look the part. 
                  Style is everything.</p>
